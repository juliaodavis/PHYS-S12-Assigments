### **Lab Day 8**

Today in lab, we worked on CNC Milling. Specifically, the focus of lab was on the ShopBot. Adwoa, Fahtrnaz, and I made a heart. To begin, we uploaded the STL file to a Flash Drive, and inserted the flash drive into the computer. The file looked like this on the computer originally.

Next, we worked on examining and editing the cuts. First, we set the drill bit to a 1/2 inch bit (the biggest bit avalible). We chose this size because the insulation material is relatively easy to cut through, and the heart did not require very precise cutting by any means. We then set the first rough cut, and two other more exact cuts to smooth over the ruff edges. For the second of the ruff cuts, we did the same cut strokes, just rotated 90 degrees. Below is what the heart looked like with all of the cut lines drawn through it.

Then, we drilled down a new piece of wood to the platform, and hot glued the edges of the insulation to insure that it would not rotate. We also zeroed the axis.

We pressed start and watched the ShopBot cut the heart. A time-lapse of part of this process is displayed below.
