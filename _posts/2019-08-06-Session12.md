### Final Project
The idea I have for my final project is a leotard that will effectively regulate body temperature. The overall goal and function of this weareable technology would be to enhance ballet class and rehersal. I was also thinking about having a setting that you can turn on 5-10 minutes before class that will warm up your muscles, to allow for an even better class. This feature could also be used after a substantial break to avoid injury from jumping right into the material. I was even thinking that maybe it could regulate how much one sweats, and what the recomended dose of water is based off of that. 

Preliminary Ideas (6/28)
1. Nanotechnology sensors - smaller easier to attach to clothing
	- graphene is flexible
	- something lightweight 
2. Probably would just attach to the leotard in multiple places
