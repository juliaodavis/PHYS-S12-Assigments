### **Final Project**

Originally, my plan for my final project was to make a wearable technology device that would regulate body temperature. Essentially, my plan was to create a leotard that could manually warm the wearer up before class and then automatically cool them down during class. My original prototype was a circuit where a change in temperature resulted in different LED's lighting up based on how great the change in temperature was from the baseline. Moving forward with the mechanical process, however, proved to be quite difficult. From substantial research regarding textiles and wearable technology, I discovered that this project did not seem very feasabile. In my research, I stumbled upon researchers at the University of Maryland who developed a cloth coated in nanotubes that effectively could regulate body temperature. How this works is that when the wearer warms up, the fibers in the cloth tighten, allowing for bigger gaps in the cloth, and thus more ventalation. When the wearer cooled down, the cloth expanded to allow for greater insulation.

I decided to move on to a different final project topic. My idea now is to create a guitar neck with LED's that will light up when a finger touches the fret that the LED is on. My idea is to use copper tape to create this circuit.

 **Lecture - 7/18**
 Today in lecture, we learned about capacitors. A capacitor consits of two plates that conduct and then an insulated material in between. The capacitance increases with an increase in area of the plates or a decrease in the distance between the plates. Next, using just one copper plate, we created a touch sensor. To create this, we put a resistor (1-10 Mega-Ohm's) into the digital 5 and 7 pin and then the end of the copper plate into digital pin 5. At first I had trouble fitting both the resistor and the wire attached to the copper plate into the same pin, but then I found out that it is much easier if you just twist the resistor around the part of the wire that is stripped. Once this set-up is complete, you can copy the arduino code for this from [here](https://roberthart56.github.io/SCFAB/SC_lab/Sensors/CapacitiveTouch/CapacitiveTouch.txt). Also make sure to download the capacitance library in arduino or the program will not run. For sketches and a fully fleshed out explanation and documentation of this process [click here](https://roberthart56.github.io/SCFAB/SC_lab/Sensors/CapacitiveTouch/index.html).

 This was a particularly interesting assigment in lecture because it related quite directly to my final project. As mentioned above, I was planning on using copper tape that would complete the circuit to the LED once pressed by a finger. This was a great way to get some exposure into this aspect of my final project. Prior to this, I created a simple circuit with four LED's solder to copper tape in parallel with jumper cables attached to the anode end and one jumper cable connected to the cathode of all four LED's. This was a very initial prototype, but it was helpful to learn about and pratice soldering on copper tape as well as have an initial vision for my project.
