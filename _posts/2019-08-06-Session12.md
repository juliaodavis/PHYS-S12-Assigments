### **Final Project**
The idea I have for my final project is a leotard that will effectively regulate body temperature. The overall goal and function of this weareable technology would be to enhance ballet class and rehersal. I was also thinking about having a setting that you can turn on 5-10 minutes before class that will warm up your muscles, to allow for an even better class. This feature could also be used after a substantial break to avoid injury from jumping right into the material. I was even thinking that maybe it could regulate how much one sweats, and what the recomended dose of water is based off of that. 

Preliminary Ideas (6/28): 

1. Nanotechnology sensors - smaller easier to attach to clothing
	- graphene is flexible
	- something lightweight 
2. Probably would just attach to the leotard in multiple places
3. Protection - would like to somehow protect the device

**Final Project Progress - 6/28**

During lab today, I built a circuit with a resistor and a thermistor. I also attahced three jumper wires to the ground, 5 votls, and A0. I then used a program in arduino that measures the temperature. My plan for this initial stage in the project is to show a change in brightness of an LED due to a change in temperature. I will do this initial protoype on a nano instead. From there, I plan to work towards replacing the LED with something that will change the temperature. I also have been thinking that I will possibily have manual and automatic componemts to this wearable technology. My idea is that the component that could heat the body up before class will be manual, and then the part that will cool the body down will be due to an automatic response of a certain temperature.

Some things to keep in mind:

	- The resistance of the thermistor must equal the resistance of the resistor
	- The first jumper wire (yellow) goes to the 5V
	- The second jumper wire (orange) goes to the ground pin
	- The third jumper wire (green) goes to A0 pin

**Final Project Progress - 7/3**

During lab today, I worked on soldering an arduino nano to a breadboard. Because this is going to be werable technology, I felt that it would be best to use a smaller circuitboard to make it more pratical. The key with soldering is to put the soldering iron on the metal ring which you want to solder. Then, you place the solder on the ring, but not touching the soldering iron. This way, as little solder as possible will get on the iron. Then, once the ring is hot enough, the solder witll melt and fill the gaps in the hole surrounding the pin, enabeling a strong connection. As you may be able to see on the image on the left, there is something around a couple of pins on the right side of the board. This is called flux. Essentially, if you ever put too much solder around the top of the pin, then there is a high chance that the electrical connection will be too weak. But if you squirt a little bit of flux on the pins where this is a problem, the flux will remove oxidized metal and prevent further oxidization, allowing a stronger connection.

**Final Project Progress - 7/5**

During lab today, I rebuilt the circuit above adding in a LED and with the arduino nano. For the arduino nano, you just have to place the pins in the same electrical line on the board rather than inserting them into the board as you do for an arduino uno.

Next, I worked on loading the code onto the nano arduino (link to code above). However, I kept getting an error message that said there was a problem uploading to board. I made sure that under tools I had selected "Ardunino Nano" for the board, the Old Bootloader for the processor, USBtinyISP. For the port, however, the arduino nano was not an option, and all the other ports were hardware and did not work. In an effort to get my computer to recognize
