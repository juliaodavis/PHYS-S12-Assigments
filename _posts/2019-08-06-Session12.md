### **Finished Final Project**

My final project is a guitar fretboard with an LED on each fretboard that lights up when pressed by a finger to be used to pratice on the go.

**If I had more time / Next steps:**
1. Soldered the circuit to a breaboard as the resistors were very fragile and often would bump into each other, providing an incorrect reading/current/voltage (although the heat shrink defintley helped that a lot)

2. Add strings! Earlier in the course, I applied the capacitive touch sensor to the strings and it was successful in turning on an LED!

3. Add tones so that when a string is pressed that exact note is played. I plan try to measure capacitiance differences across the string to produce this.

4. Power from a 9V or other external power supply besides my computer. This may involve using a different type of sensor or redoing the copper tape so that it is one strand rather than multiple strands (the other side of the copper tape is not conductive).

Overall, I learned a ton and had an awesome semester! I cannot believe that it is over, but I look forward to hopefully continuing with this and other projects in the future!
