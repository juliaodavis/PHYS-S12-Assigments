### **Final Project**
The idea I have for my final project is a leotard that will effectively regulate body temperature. The overall goal and function of this weareable technology would be to enhance ballet class and rehersal. I was also thinking about having a setting that you can turn on 5-10 minutes before class that will warm up your muscles, to allow for an even better class. This feature could also be used after a substantial break to avoid injury from jumping right into the material. I was even thinking that maybe it could regulate how much one sweats, and what the recomended dose of water is based off of that. 

Preliminary Ideas (6/28)
1. Nanotechnology sensors - smaller easier to attach to clothing
	- graphene is flexible
	- something lightweight 
2. Probably would just attach to the leotard in multiple places
3. Protection - would like to somehow protect the device 

Inspiration

**Final Project Progress - 6/28**

During lab today, I built a circuit with a resistor and a thermistor. I also attahced three jumper wires to the ground, 5 votls, and A0. I then used a program in arduino that measures the temperature. My plan for this initial stage in the project is to show a change in brightness of an LED due to a change in temperature. I will do this initial protoype on a nano instead. From there, I plan to work towards replacing the LED with something that will change the temperature. I also have been thinking that I will possibily have manual and automatic componemts to this wearable technology. My idea is that the component that could heat the body up before class will be manual, and then the part that will cool the body down will be due to an automatic response of a certain temperature. I also found this very helpful video that I was working off of: [Make an Arduino Temperature Sensor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_XkGju35MI)

Some things to keep in mind:

	- The resistance of the thermistor must equal the resistance of the resistor
	- <font color="FFDA33">The first jumper wire (yellow) goes to the 5V
	- <font color="FF9633">The second jumper wire (orange) goes to the ground pin 
	- <font color="2B8A14">The third jumper wire (green) goes to A0 pin
