### **Lab Day 9**

Today the focus of lab was on electronic output devices. During lecture, we discussed many different types of output devices, such as motors, sollenoids, and RGB LED's. My idea was to turn on individual LED lights on a strip of LED's. First, I cut a piece of carboard that was the same length as the strip of eight LED's using an x-acto knife. I then put a piece of copper tape along the carboard and labeled with blue sharpie where each LED section was.

To make this a position sensor, I decided to varry the amount of layers of insulation tape. Because I was tight on time, I only put the insulationt tape on part of each LED section. Had I had more time, I would have put it over the entire section. The way that I did it was still effective, however, I just had to be mindful to only touch the black part. I put no layers of insulation tape on the first section, and then for every subsequent section, I added an additional layer of insulation tape, all the way up to seven layers on the eigth section. Then, I soldered a wire to one end of the copper. I also soldered a 1 Mega-Ohm resistor to the other end of the wire.
