### **Lab Day 9**

Today the focus of lab was on electronic output devices. During lecture, we discussed many different types of output devices, such as motors, sollenoids, and RGB LED's. My idea was to turn on individual LED lights on a strip of LED's. First, I cut a piece of carboard that was the same length as the strip of eight LED's using an x-acto knife. I then put a piece of copper tape along the carboard and labeled with blue sharpie where each LED section was.
