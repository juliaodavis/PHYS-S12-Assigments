### **Lab Day #2** 

**Lecture - 6/27**

In lecture today, we used an arduino program to measure the voltage in a circuit with a resitor and LED. After completing the circuit, we added one addiitonal wire as a probe. This probe can be placed at any point along the circuit and a number will appear on the computer. We found that the number ranged from 0, which meant 0 volts, to 1024, which indicated 5 volts. We also found that due to the different frequencies of different colors in the spectrum, there was a different voltage drop associated with each LED. For instance, the voltage drop across a red LED was about 2 volts, while the voltage drop across a green adn blue LED was closer to 3 volts. This is because the voltage drop is realted to the amount of energy required to produce the light. The voltage drop across the resistor is due to the energy being converted into heat. We also were able to apply Ohm's Law to this circuit.
