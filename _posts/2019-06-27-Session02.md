### **Lab Day #2** 

**Lecture - 6/27**

In lecture today, we used an arduino program to measure the voltage in a circuit with a resitor and LED. After completing the circuit, we added one addiitonal wire as a probe. This probe can be placed at any point along the circuit and a number will appear on the computer. We found that the number ranged from 0, which meant 0 volts, to 1024, which indicated 5 volts. We also found that due to the different frequencies of different colors in the spectrum, there was a different voltage drop associated with each LED. For instance, the voltage drop across a red LED was about 2 volts, while the voltage drop across a green and blue LED was closer to 3 volts. This is because the voltage drop is realted to the amount of energy required to produce the light. The voltage drop across the resistor is due to the energy being converted into heat. We also were able to apply Ohm's Law to this circuit. 

**Lab - 6/28**

In lab today, we leraned about different tools and then got to pratice using them. We began but cutting a few different materials using a saw. The first saw we used was a push saw which means that it cuts in the forward direction. 

We praticed cutting a wooden dowel and then a piece of acrylic. We then tried cutting these materials again, but with a pull saw which means that it cuts when you pull. I found this saw much easier to work with.

We then worked with using a hacksaw to cut a metal rod. Once we cut it, we wanted to smooth out the edges. To do this, we used a file.

Next, our task was to fit the metal rod we cut inside a piece of plastic. To do this, we learned how to use the drill press. We determined the appropriate drill bit based on the diameter of the metal rod, which we measured with a micrometer. We then screwed it into the drill press, turned it on, and rotated the knob down to where we wanted it on the plastic. Once the plastic was cut, we placed the metal rod into the hole in the plastic. Because the hole was a little big, we put super glue around the outside of the metal before placing it into the plastic. 

Lastly, we use the x-acto knives to cut pieces of cardboard. It is important to always move your body out of the way of the line of the knife so that you will not get injured in case you have a clean follow-through of the knife. It also is important to note that you do not need to push down on the blade very hard.
