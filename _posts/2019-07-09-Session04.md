### **Lab Day 4**

During lab today, I worked on a prototype for my final project. My idea is to show that I can control three LED's with a signal from a temperature sensor. I set up my arduino code so that the default or "baseline" temperature would be 24.5 C, and at this temperature, all three LED's are turned off. Then, a temperature increase of 1 C and 5 C corresponds to the blue LED lighting up. A temperature increase between 5 C and 10 C corresponds to the blue and white LED's lighting up. And finally, any temperature increase greater than 10 C corresponds to all three LED's lighting up.

I ran into quite a few problems getting this to work, however. 
1. I could not get my computer (Mac Book Pro) to upload code onto the arduino
	- I kept getting the error message of "problem uploading to board"
	- I tried downloading a driver mulitple times
	- I tried rewriting the serial information in the software
	- But my computer would not recognize the arduino nano at all
	- For this prototype, the solution was to switch back to the Uno which worked well
2. The first (and old) thermistors I was using were not very accurate 
	- I had to get the resistance of the surrounding resistors to match the resistance of the thermistor exactly
	- I tried using a multimeter to do this, but it required a lot of trial and error as long as some math and circuit diagrams as the resistance of the thermistor was about 360 Ohms
	- To solve this problem, I switched over to the digital thermistor

Finally, after many hours of trial and error with different parts and bords, I was able to create the prototype described above.
