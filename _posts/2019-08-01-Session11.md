### **Final Project**

Originally, my plan for my final project was to make a wearable technology device that would regulate body temperature. Essentially, my plan was to create a leotard that could manually warm the wearer up before class and then automatically cool them down during class. My original prototype was a circuit where a change in temperature resulted in different LED's lighting up based on how great the change in temperature was from the baseline. Moving forward with the mechanical process, however, proved to be quite difficult. From substantial research regarding textiles and wearable technology, I discovered that this project did not seem very feasabile. In my research, I stumbled upon researchers at the University of Maryland who developed a cloth coated in nanotubes that effectively could regulate body temperature. How this works is that when the wearer warms up, the fibers in the cloth tighten, allowing for bigger gaps in the cloth, and thus more ventalation. When the wearer cooled down, the cloth expanded to allow for greater insulation.

I decided to move on to a different final project topic. My idea now is to create five frets of a guitar with LED's that will light up when a finger touches the fret that the LED is on. My idea is to use copper tape to create this circuit. I think this can be used as a pratice instrument on-the-go. I also hope to add in a component that will allow the note of the string to play when pressed. My initial ideas are to implement this with a buzzer.

**Lecture - 7/18**

 Today in lecture, we learned about capacitors. A capacitor consits of two plates that conduct and then an insulated material in between. The capacitance increases with an increase in area of the plates or a decrease in the distance between the plates. Next, using just one copper plate, we created a touch sensor. To create this, we put a resistor (1-10 Mega-Ohm's) into the digital 5 and 7 pin and then the end of the copper plate into digital pin 5. At first I had trouble fitting both the resistor and the wire attached to the copper plate into the same pin, but then I found out that it is much easier if you just twist the resistor around the part of the wire that is stripped. Once this set-up is complete, you can copy the arduino code for this [from here](https://roberthart56.github.io/SCFAB/SC_lab/Sensors/CapacitiveTouch/CapacitiveTouch.txt). Also make sure to download the capacitance library in arduino or the program will not run. For sketches and a fully fleshed out explanation and documentation of this process [click here](https://roberthart56.github.io/SCFAB/SC_lab/Sensors/CapacitiveTouch/index.html).

 This was a particularly interesting assigment in lecture because it related quite directly to my final project. As mentioned above, I was planning on using copper tape that would complete the circuit to the LED once pressed by a finger. This was a great way to get some exposure into this aspect of my final project. Prior to this, I created a simple circuit with four LED's solder to copper tape in parallel with jumper cables attached to the anode end and one jumper cable connected to the cathode of all four LED's. This was a very initial prototype, but it was helpful to learn about and pratice soldering on copper tape as well as have an initial vision for my project. (The micro arduino can be used to power this circuit).

Next, I moved on to designing how the electronics would fit in fusion. My plan was to laser cut the neck with specially designed compartments for electronics, such as the pro micro, LED on copper tape, resistor, and wires. I used an add-on called Guitar Engine which can be <a href='guitarEngineBeta_v005-3' download>downloaded here</a> to sketch the electronics on. I originally chose to go with this add-on because I found it very hard to model a guitar as not only are there many complex pieces, but it is not very uniform as the neck widens slightly and every fret is smaller than the previous one. This is what the guitar neck from the add-on looks like in fusion.

I took some measurements of the pro micro arduino board and then decided how much space I wanted for the LED's. After changing the measurements around, I settled on this design as the compartment for four of the LEDs.

Then, using the <a href='guitarEngineBeta_v005-3' download>Guitar Engine add-on</a>, I wanted to add these skecthes for the electronics onto the back of the neck to see how it would look spaced. This was quite difficult as the guitar engine add-on proved to be trying to work with. Although it was a great starting off point, it ended up being very difficult to manipulate the pieces how I wanted them. For instance, I was unable to copy, paste, or isolate certain sections as well as make sketches on top of the guitar.

After talking with Nathan, we concluded that it would not be feasible or realistic to design the entire neck for many reasons. First, I could not make a functional neck as there is nearly a whole science about information about necks mainting a certain temperature due to humidity or outside tmperatures. Also, my current design required a seperate pro micro arduino for each LED (4-6 depending on how many LEDs I chose). Latsly, it just made more sense to devlop a pratice tool that consisted of about five frets. 
<BR>
My next step was to work in fusion to design this guitar neck with five frets. I decided to import a photo from the internet as a canvas and trace around that to create the five frets of the neck. I also added a hole on each fret for the LED. This is the guitar that I used and this is how it looked in fusion when I traced around it using the line tool, primarily.

I then used this sketch and exported it to the laser cutter. In order to make sure that the frets did not end up as distict pieces, I highlet all of the fret lines (the four ones in the middle) and made them a different color. I then chose for the power to be a maximum of 1% on all of these lines so that the laser cutter would just score across this part rather than actually cutting through the material (the setting used for the other cuts was 60%).

It took quite a few trys to get this to fit the strip of LED's, but eventually after some measuring and trial and error, it worked! Next, my plan is to implement the touch component and the electronics. My vision is that this could be a pratice tool for people who want to play guitar on the go.

After fidling around with the eletronics, I decided it would be best to use strip LEDs instead of the individual LED. My next step was to see if I could use a guitar string pressing against a copper wire to complete a circuit and ultimatley turn on an LED. I used the [touch sensor setup](https://roberthart56.github.io/SCFAB/SC_lab/Sensors/CapacitiveTouch/index.html) as a basis for this. I cut a piece of copper conductive tape and placed it at the bottom of one of the frets. I then soldered a wire to this. Next, I connected the LED to digital pin 13 and the ground. You can find the code I used for this below. As you can see, I added an averaging function to the touch sensor and LED code.
