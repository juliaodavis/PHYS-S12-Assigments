### **Lab Day 3** 

**Lecture - 7/2**

In lecture today, we learned how to use Fusion 360 to construct a 2D sketch, extrude it, and then download it as a DXF file which can be used in the laser cutter. 

1. From sketch menu chose create sketch and select the (x,y) plane
2. From sketch menu chose the shape you would like to construct (in this case we chose 2-point rectangle)
3. Set the rectangle where you want it and the dimensions you want it to have
4. You can add dimensions by pressing "d" and then selecting the side you want the dimension to go on
5. Press "o" to offset the sides to create the notches
	- To get the offset line inside of the rectangle, use a negative number
6. From the sketch pallet, chose construction
7. Press "l" and sketch two construction lines from the midpoint of one side to the midpoint of the opposite side 
	- Do this for both sides
	- If a triangle is shown when you hover over a line, that means you are at the midpoint
7. Go to sketch pallet and unselect construction lines
8. Press offset and select one of the middle lines
	- For the dimension, chose something slightly smaller than half the thickness of the material
	- Repeat for the other line 
9. Chose mirror from the sketch menu
	- Click on the line you want to mirror first
	- Then change the selection in the little box menu to mirror line 
	- Chose the line you want to mirror it over
	- Repeat this for the other construction line
10. Press stop sketch in the top right hand corner
11. Press the home button (next to the x,y,z)
12. Press "e" for extrude
	- Select all the sections you want to keep in blue
	- The dimension should be about the thickness of the material
13. You can press "f" to fillet some of the sharp corners if you would like
14. Right click on the sketch to "export as DXF"

**Lab - 7/3**

Today in lab, we worked on creating our own shapes with fusion 360. Once we were finished with that, we cut it out of the laser cutter and made a press fit kit. The first time that I printed mine out of the laser, I had filleted the edges too extremely so that the pieces were slightly lose. The next time, I did not fillet as much and also chose to make the kerf smaller.

add DXF files 

Next, we learned how to make a greyscale sketch with the laser cutter.

Laser cutting proved to be an integral part of my final project. For a more detailed description of my final project [click here](https://juliaodavis.github.io/PHYS-S12-Assigments/11/). I used laser cutting to create the front of my fretboard in carboard and then eventually in wood.

 I also used laser cutting to create a box of electronics that I was planning on implementing into my final project. This is what my box looked like on the [MakerCase Wesbite](https://en.makercase.com).

 This is how my box looked like once I used a hot glue gun to glue the edges together and then implemented it into my final project.

 I also used the laser cutter when creating the back of the neck for my final project.
