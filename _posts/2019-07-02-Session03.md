### **Lab Day 3** 

**Lecture - 7/2**

In lecture today, we learned how to use Fusion 360 to construct a 2D sketch, extrude it, and then download it as a DXF file which can be used in the laser cutter. 

1. From sketch menu chose create sketch and select the (x,y) plane
2. From sketch menu chose the shape you would like to construct (in this case we chose 2-point rectangle)
3. Set the rectangle where you want it and the dimensions you want it to have
4. You can add dimensions by pressing "d" and then selecting the side you want the dimension to go on
5. Press "o" to offset the sides to create the notches
	- To get the offset line inside of the rectangle, use a negative number
6. From the sketch pallet, chose construction
7. Press "l" and sketch two construction lines from the midpoint of one side to the midpoint of the opposite side 
	- Do this for both sides
	- If a triangle is shown when you hover over a line, that means you are at the midpoint
7. Go to sketch pallet and un-select construction
