### **Lab Day 5**

**Lecture 7/11**

Today in lecture, we explored basic arduino programming. The first circuit we set up was call a pullup circuit. This is where pressing on the switch turns the LED on. Next, we switched it to a pulldown circuit. This is where pressing on the switch turns the LED off. We also learned about conditional statements, logical operations, and for loops. Conditional statements are something that I was familiar with as my initial prototype ([click here](https://juliaodavis.github.io/PHYS-S12-Assigments/04/)) used conditional statemtns. For my prototype the conditional statements were "if" something about the temperature is true (for example, it is 5 C higher than the baseline), then certain LED(s) would turn on. I was not familar with logical operations nor for loops. Logical operations use different symbols, such as ampersands, to enable more than one expression to be considered at the same time. For loops are used for repetitive commands.
