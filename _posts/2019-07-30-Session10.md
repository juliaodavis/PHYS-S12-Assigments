### **Lab Day 10**

In lecture, we learned about molding and casting, as well as wearable textiles. Because neither of these topics were directled related to my final project, I decided to make a mold of a small dog statue/paperweight that I had. To begin, I put clay on the bottom of the dogs feet and then I put it inside of a cup. The shape of the dog was quite convient as I did not have to attach any additional supports because the dog could just rest on its feet.

 Next, I created a mixture of two different types of silicon (of about equal parts) in a cup. I used a popsicle stick to stir the mixture. To minimize the bubbles, you should stir the mixture in a figure-eight, moving side-to-side rather than around in a circle. Bubbles are problematic for the rest of the process as they can lead to deformations.

Then, I poured this mixture into the cup with the dog. I pinched the end of the cup to make a funnel spout to make the pouring more controlled. When pouring, it is important, again, to avoid bubbles. Some ways you can do this is by "ribboning" -- or overlaping layers of the mixture in the same part. You should also pour slowly.
