### **Lab Day 10**

In lecture, we learned about molding and casting, as well as wearable textiles. Because neither of these topics were directled related to my final project, I decided to make a mold of a small dog statue/paperweight that I had. To begin, I put clay on the bottom of the dogs feet and then I put it inside of a cup. The shape of the dog was quite convient as I did not have to attach any additional supports because the dog could just rest on its feet.

 Next, I created a mixture of two different types of silicon (of about equal parts) in a cup. I used a popsicle stick to stir the mixture. To minimize the bubbles, you should stir the mixture in a figure-eight, moving side-to-side rather than around in a circle. Bubbles are problematic for the rest of the process as they can lead to deformations.

Then, I poured this mixture into the cup with the dog. I pinched the end of the cup to make a funnel spout to make the pouring more controlled. When pouring, it is important, again, to avoid bubbles. Some ways you can do this is by "ribboning" -- or overlaping layers of the mixture in the same part. You should also pour slowly. Finally, you should try to pour around your object rather than on top of it as this will make it harder for bubbles to form underneath surfaces where there is a gap of liquid. I found that it was most difficult for me to pour around the dogs head as it was so close to the end of the cup that there was not a lot of space for the liquid to pour through without touching the head of the dog.

Once I had finished pouring the silicon, the cup looked like this.
