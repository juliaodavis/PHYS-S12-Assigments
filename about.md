 <font color="blue">My name is Julia Davis, and I am a rising senior at Newton North High School. Although I have had minimal exposure to digiital fabrication, I am very passionate about the sciences, specifically physics, and the arts, specifically ballet and electric guitar. Though I have certainly cultivated these interests separately, I have also pursed the two disciplines together. For instance, at my high school , I founded STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math) Club. Through hands-on experiments, our goal is to expand artistic and scientific understanding in students and facilitate engaging discussions outside of the classroom. We also have been very fortunate to host guest speakers from the department of Physics at Harvard University as well as from the Museum of Science. I also founded Student Artists for Science Education, an organization devoted to brining together art and science in order to create more science opportunities in underserved schools. We had our first event in May (2019), and we raised over $2500. This event featured performances by dancers from All That Jazz Dance Studio and Boston Ballet, talented student musicians from Newton North, a 12 year-old world-class violinist, and an auction of student art./font>
